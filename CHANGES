Version 0.001
=============

Internal version.


Version 0.002
=============

Initial public release.


Version 0.003
=============

Work around bug with taint checking and fork on some versions of Windows,
  by skipping those tests.

Work around broken nonblocking file reads on some versions of Windows,
  by using select instead.

AFAIK, this fixes all of the bugs that stopped earlier versions from working
  on Windows XP.


Version 0.004
=============

Fix performance problem where we ended up polling the COM port in a
  tight loop.  Instead we read one character at a time, which isn't ideal
  either, but is much better (3-4% CPU usage instead of 95%).  Maybe an
  expert on Device::SerialPort can provide advice on how best to do this.
